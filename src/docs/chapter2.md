# State Variables

State variables are variables whose values are permanently stored in contract storage.

# Functions

Functions are the executable units of code. Functions are usually defined inside a contract, but they can also be defined outside of contracts.

# Events

Events are convenience interfaces with the EVM logging facilities.

# Errors

Errors allow you to define descriptive names and data for failure situations. Errors can be used in revert statements. In comparison to string descriptions, errors are much cheaper and allow you to encode additional data. You can use NatSpec to describe the error to the user.

# Struct

Structs are custom defined types that can group several variables.

# Enum

Enums can be used to create custom types with a finite set of ‘constant values’
